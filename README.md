Hello! My name's Chris, I'm an italian developer born in 2XXX ;)  
My day job is mainly focused on development and maintenance of cloud data solutions for big clients, so I don't have a lot of time for personal projects - and most of the personal projects were aimed to make life simpler during my day job anyway :)   
  
I've been programming since I was 11, when I started learning C++ because I wanted to develop mods and gamemodes in a C-like language called PAWN, which I used to create a server for my online friends to play in together! I then moved on to Java to develop Minecraft mods for personal use - I never released anything. Ever since then I've learned a lot more, but I don't feel like this is the right place to list my competences - this isn't LinkedIn after all :)  
  
This hub will mostly be used as a diary to share my personal projects - and also so that I don't forget them.
